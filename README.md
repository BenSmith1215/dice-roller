## Dice Roller
  This program allows you to roll a 6-sided dice up to 5 times, giving a random number output between 1 and 6. 

### A combination of ChatGPT and general coding guides was used in order to put the program together

The website runs from the Index.html file, which calls the DiceRoller.css and DiceRoller.js files within for formatting and execution.
